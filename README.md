# breast-cancer-classification

### The Dataset
We’ll use the IDC_regular dataset (the breast [cancer histology image dataset!](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images/)) from Kaggle. This dataset holds 2,77,524 patches of size 50×50 extracted from 162 whole mount slide images of breast cancer specimens scanned at 40x. Of these, 1,98,738 test negative and 78,786 test positive with IDC. 
Please try to run [data_visualization!](data_visualization.ipynb) first to get better idea of the data.
